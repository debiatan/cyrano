Cyrano provides a Python interface to control an Arduino Duemilanove device via a serial connection.

Instructions of use (Debian/Ubuntu):
====================================

- Writing the firmware:
    Install the following packages: gcc-avr avr-libc binutils-avr avrdude

    Run 'make' to generate the file 'cyrano.hex'
    Connect the arduino via USB. Normally, it will be assigned the device identifier '/dev/ttyUSB0'.
    Press the reset button in the Duemilanove and quickly run 'make upload' (the timing is important in this one, since the device will only wait for around half a second for the .hex image to be uploaded).

- Accessing it from python
    (WIP)
